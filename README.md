# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Resume Builder - Home Component

The Home component is a crucial part of the Resume Builder application. It is responsible for rendering and managing the sections of a resume. Let's explore each component and function in detail:

### Components

#### Switch Component

The Switch component is a custom component specifically designed for the Resume Builder. It represents a toggle switch that allows the user to enable or disable a particular feature. Its purpose within the Home component is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be utilized to control certain functionality related to the sections.

#### ColorButton Component

The ColorButton component is a styled button component imported from the Material-UI library. It provides a colored button with a specific style. In the Home component, it is used to display the "Save and Next" button. The button is styled with a purple color scheme, and its appearance changes when hovered over or clicked.

### Functions

#### handleEditClick(index)

The `handleEditClick` function is triggered when the user clicks on the "Edit" button associated with a section. Its purpose is to enable the edit mode for that section, allowing the user to modify the section's name.

#### handleSaveClick(index)

When the user clicks on the "Save" button associated with a section, the `handleSaveClick` function is triggered. It disables the edit mode for that section, saves the changes made to the section's name, and updates the sections state accordingly.

#### handleInputChange(index, event)

The `handleInputChange` function is responsible for updating the edited section's name as the user types in the input field. It is triggered whenever there is a change event on the input field associated with a section. The function retrieves the index of the section and the new value entered by the user, and then updates the editedSections state to reflect the changes.

#### handleSectionClick(index)

When the user clicks on a section, the `handleSectionClick` function is triggered. It allows the user to select a section and displays additional information about the section. However, the exact purpose and implementation details of this feature are not explicitly specified in the code snippet.

#### handleSectionHover(index)

The `handleSectionHover` function is called when the user hovers over a section. It is responsible for displaying a tooltip or information box that shows the message associated with the section being hovered. The purpose of this feature is to provide additional context or details about a section when the user interacts with it.

#### handleBoxClose(event)

Whenever the user clicks on the close button of the additional information box associated with a section, the `handleBoxClose` function is triggered. It closes the box and deselects the section, allowing the user to interact with other sections.

#### handleDragEnd(event)

The `handleDragEnd` function is triggered when the user finishes dragging a section to a new position within the drag area. It updates the order of the sections based on the new position and ensures that the changes are reflected in the sections state. This functionality enables the user to reorder the sections according to their preference.

These functions, along with the components and state variables used in the Home component, work together to provide a dynamic and interactive interface for managing and customizing the sections of a resume in the Resume Builder application.
